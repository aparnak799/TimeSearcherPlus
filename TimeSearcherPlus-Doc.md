# TimeSearcherPlus - Technical Documentation
TimeSearcher+ is an interactive temporal data querying widget. Designed for standalone or integrated use in larger applications, its hallmark is direct manipulation of temporal datasets with multiple attributes. The widget introduces a reactive feature, a significant enhancement from its predecessors, which meets the demands of domain experts and users alike. Users can craft bounding boxes, termed "TimeBoxes," which act as constraints on the dataset, enabling them to meticulously select data intervals. Subsequently, they can analyze and compare trends within these intervals, grouping their findings for later reference or hiding.
